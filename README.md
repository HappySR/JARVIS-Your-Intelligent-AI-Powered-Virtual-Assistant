# JARVIS-Your-Intelligent-AI-Powered-Virtual-Assistant
Introduction

JARVIS is a user-friendly Python application designed to empower you with seamless voice control. It leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5-turbo model to understand your requests and provide a natural, interactive experience.

Features

• Intuitive Voice Control: Activate JARVIS with the wake word "Jarvis" and issue commands using your natural voice.
<br>
• Web Navigation: Open websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and GitHub with simple voice instructions.
<br>
• Music Management: Access your music library (defined in musicLibrary.py) and play songs by voice command.
<br>
• News Updates: Stay informed by requesting news headlines. JARVIS retrieves and reads them out loud to you.
<br>
• OpenAI Integration: Harness the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for intelligent responses and handling complex requests beyond predefined commands.

Installation

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can verify this by running python3 --version in your terminal.
2. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip install speech_recognition webbrowser pyttsx3 musicLibrary requests openai gtts pygame.
<br>
Usage

1. Run the Script: Execute the application by running python main.py in your terminal.
2. Wake Word: Say "Jarvis" to activate JARVIS.
3. Voice Commands: Speak your requests clearly.
<br>
Example Commands:
<br>
<br>
• "Open Google"
<br>
• "Play [Song Name]" (from your music library)
<br>
• "What's the news?"
<br>
• Ask general questions (handled by OpenAI)
<br>
• "Open GitHub"
<br>
<br>
Customization
<br>
<br>
• Music Library: Edit the musicLibrary.py file to define your music library with song names and links.
<br>
• OpenAI API Key: Replace <Your Key Here> in main.py with your OpenAI API key for optimal AI interaction.
<br>
• News API Key: Replace <Your Key Here> in main.py with your News API key to access news updates. You can obtain a free API key from https://newsapi.org/.
<br>
<br>
Project Structure
<br>
<br>
• main.py: The core script that runs the application.
<br>
• musicLibrary.py (optional): Defines your music library.
