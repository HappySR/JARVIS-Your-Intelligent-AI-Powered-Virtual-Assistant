# JARVIS-Your-Intelligent-AI-Powered-Virtual-Assistant
Introduction

JARVIS is a user-friendly Python application designed to empower you with seamless voice control. It leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5-turbo model to understand your requests and provide a natural, interactive experience.

Features

Intuitive Voice Control: Activate JARVIS with the wake word "Jarvis" and issue commands using your natural voice.
Web Navigation: Open websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and GitHub with simple voice instructions.
Music Management: Access your music library (defined in musicLibrary.py) and play songs by voice command.
News Updates: Stay informed by requesting news headlines. JARVIS retrieves and reads them out loud to you.
OpenAI Integration: Harness the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for intelligent responses and handling complex requests beyond predefined commands.
Installation

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can verify this by running python3 --version in your terminal.
Install Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries using pip install speech_recognition webbrowser pyttsx3 musicLibrary requests openai gtts pygame.
Usage

Run the Script: Execute the application by running python main.py in your terminal.
Wake Word: Say "Jarvis" to activate JARVIS.
Voice Commands: Speak your requests clearly.
Example Commands:

"Open Google"
"Play [Song Name]" (from your music library)
"What's the news?"
Ask general questions (handled by OpenAI)
"Open GitHub"
Customization

Music Library: Edit the musicLibrary.py file to define your music library with song names and links.
OpenAI API Key: Replace <Your Key Here> in main.py with your OpenAI API key for optimal AI interaction.
News API Key: Replace <Your Key Here> in main.py with your News API key to access news updates. You can obtain a free API key from https://newsapi.org/.
Project Structure

main.py: The core script that runs the application.
musicLibrary.py (optional): Defines your music library.
utils.py (optional): Can be used for utility functions (e.g., error handling).
Further Enhancements

Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling to provide informative messages to the user.
Context Awareness: Explore techniques to understand the context of user commands for improved responsiveness.
Customization: Allow users to personalize the wake word, voice style, and other preferences.
Desktop Integration: Integrate JARVIS with your desktop environment for a more seamless experience.
